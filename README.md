# Blender-TIFF-Grid-Import
Import of TIFF Grid Files (.tif) into Blender

I created this addon solely to enable more efficient use of the MNS from IGN, which is always in GeoTIFF format.

This Blender add-on is designed to import TIFF Grid Files (.tif) into Blender, enhancing the software's capabilities with geospatial data visualization. Originally developed for importing ASCII Grid Files (ESRI), this fork adapts the tool to handle TIFF files.

## Installation
To install this add-on:
1. Open Blender and navigate to `Edit` > `Preferences`.
2. In the `Add-ons` section, click `Installâ€¦` and select the add-on file from your computer.

## Usage
Once installed, a new import option titled "TIFF Grid (.tif)" will appear in Blender's import menu. Selecting this option will prompt you to import a TIFF Grid file into your current Blender project.
