# Blender-ASCII-Grid-Import
Import of ASCII Grid (.asc) for Blender

This Blender Add-on imports ASCII Grid Files (ESRI) into Blender. To install, go to Blender's User Preferences and run the "Install from Fileâ€¦" command.
After installing the script, Blender's Import menu will be added an item called "ASCII Grid (.asc)". You will then be prompted to import the data.
